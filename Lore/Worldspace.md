We were received at Skyveil Castle by Sir Ruan, the Key Knight.

Ser Ruan requested we investigate frustrations in Edgeglade.
We travelled north along the serpents spine river.
We met the Talon Knight at the Birch Hall in [[Edgeglade]], they had an antler chandelier.
The Talon Knight and the people of [[Edgeglade]] asked us to assist with various quests.

Whilst investigating a great plain east of [[Edgeglade]], we discovered Blood Moss that creeped over living mattered and drained it's succour.

We travelled to and met the Dreaming seer who takes residence in Stars Hollow.

Whilst camping, we were sought by a terrible arachnid beast. When exploring it's home it made threats, and paralysed poor ser Balin.

Travel to the [[The Parched Hold]] for guidance from a seer, we travelled by ship and met [[Ulksip]] a goth girl spider mommy.
A snowy desert turned into a plain of corpses caught in a blizzard.

The parched seer advised us to find the snow king out on the savannah.

We travelled back to [[Skyveil]] and procured a [[Warband]], and on our way to find the Snow King were ambushed once again by the great arachnid.

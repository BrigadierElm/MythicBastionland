The home of [[Talon Knight]], seated in [[The Birch Hold]]
Hugo from Edgeglade, hound missing. Unusual deaths and disappearances followed.
Oaksgrave was young and healthy, and took ill suddenly. Was the Rune knight also murdered along the serpents spine? They were consumed by stork which may have tampered with the corpse.
A young woman was run through so frequently she was transparent.

Eluna's husband brandon, a farmer, was last seen across the serpents spine before dissapearing - the dog was also seen across the spine.
